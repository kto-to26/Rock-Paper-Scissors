# Rock-Paper-Scissors
Hi everyone, this is Rock Paper Scissors in my rendition using React

This project is made on a Vite build and also on the npm package manager.
I don't claim to have perfect or even good code, because I'm just getting started with React and JS in general.
The site changes images frequently, something like 25 frames. I honestly don't know how to fix it, but I've managed to improve things a bit by speeding up the changes as much as I can.
I'd be happy to have constructive criticism!)
